# Impacts of Appearance and Abilities on the Character Alignment
There are two most essential characters to consider when creating a story. The good one and the evil one. All authors know this. However, are there any physical features or abilities that they often use when creating these characters? Based on this question, this research investigates predicting whether the characters are good or bad by looking at these features, and which method is the most appropriate one. To answer these research questions, two different data sets are merged and used.

More details about the merger process and these two data sets are shown in the data description & pre-processing part. Confirmatory data analysis & results part includes results of 6 different methods such as XGBoost, SVM, Linear Regression, etc. What can be interpreted by looking at analysis results is discussed in the discussion and conclusion part of the study.
